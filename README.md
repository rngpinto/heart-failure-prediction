# Purpose of this study:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

People with cardiovascular disease need early detection and management. For this purpose, a prediction model will be created in STATA software and the main conclusions of the analysis are presented.
